The project that I submitted was Project One. As project one wanted two different clocks with a time gap in between. It was a bit of a challenge at first, but going over the book and comparing what I would be doing wrong make everything a bit easier. I think putting the everything together and my output being wrong or just a line off made it a bit challenging because I would try erasing the new line, but the error would still appear because it ended up erasing too much.
